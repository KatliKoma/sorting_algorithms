Best case: O(n^2)
Even in the best case, the algorithm performs the same number of comparisons, making its time complexity quadratic.

Average case: O(n^2)
The average case behaves the same as the worst and best cases since the number of comparisons does not change.

Worst case: O(n^2)
The worst case occurs when the array is in reverse order, requiring the maximum number of swaps. However, the number of comparisons remains constant and does not depend on the data's initial order, keeping the time complexity quadratic.
